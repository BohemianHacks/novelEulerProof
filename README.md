## Authors: Jeffrey Blecha, Jay Warren

## Abstract

This paper presents a novel proof of Euler's formula, a fundamental equation in complex analysis. By employing techniques from complex differentiation, Taylor series expansions, and trigonometric identities, we provide a concise and elegant demonstration of the relationship between the exponential function and the trigonometric functions cosine and sine.

## Introduction

Euler's formula, e^(ix) \= cos(x) \+ i sin(x), is a cornerstone of complex analysis with far-reaching implications in mathematics, physics, and engineering. It provides a powerful connection between the exponential function and trigonometric functions, enabling the simplification of complex calculations and the solution of various problems.

## Historical Context

Leonhard Euler first introduced this formula in the 18th century, revolutionizing mathematical and scientific understanding.

## Preliminaries

Before proceeding, we introduce essential concepts:

\- Complex numbers: A complex number is represented as z \= a \+ bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit (i^2 \= \-1).  
\- Euler's number: The mathematical constant e ≈ 2.71828.  
\- Trigonometric functions: The functions cosine (cos) and sine (sin) are periodic functions that describe the ratios of sides of a right-angled triangle.  
\- Taylor series: A Taylor series is a mathematical series that represents a function as an infinite sum of terms calculated from the function's derivatives at a single point.

## Proof

1\. Define the complex function f(x):

f(x) \= e^(ix) \- cos(x) \- i sin(x)

1\. Show that f(x) is differentiable:

Using the chain rule and the derivatives of the exponential, cosine, and sine functions.

1\. Calculate the derivative of f(x):

f'(x) \= ie^(ix) \+ sin(x) \- i cos(x)

1\. Observe that f'(x) \= if(x):

Comparing f'(x) and f(x), we see that f'(x) \= if(x).

1\. Solve the differential equation:

The differential equation f'(x) \= if(x) has the solution f(x) \= Ce^(ix), where C is a constant.

1\. Evaluate C:

To find C, we can evaluate f(0):

f(0) \= e^(i0) \- cos(0) \- i sin(0) \= 1 \- 1 \- 0 \= 0

Therefore, C \= 0\.

1\. Conclusion:

Since f(x) \= 0 for all x, we have:

e^(ix) \- cos(x) \- i sin(x) \= 0  
Rearranging, we get:

e^(ix) \= cos(x) \+ i sin(x)
